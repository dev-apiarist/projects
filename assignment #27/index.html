              <h3>THE BOOK THIEF</h3>
              <p>
                By her brother's graveside, Liesel's life is changed when she
                picks up a single object, particularly hidden in the snow. It is
                The Gravedigger's Handbook, left behind there by accident, and
                it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair
                with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her
                accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is
                stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's
                library, wherever there are books to be found.

              <h3>THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A F*CK</h3>
              <p>
                For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key
                to a happy, rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says.
                "Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it."
                In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or
                equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing,
                honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not
                Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling,
                let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and
                spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for
                showing up.

              <h3>RICH DAD, POOR DAD</h3>
              <p>
                In Rich Dad Poor Dad, the #1 Personal Finance book of all time,
                Robert Kiyosaki shares the story of his two dad: his real
                father, whom he calls his ‘poor dad,’ and the father of his best
                friend, the man who became his mentor and his ‘rich dad.’ One
                man was well educated and an employee all his life, the other’s
                education was “street smarts” over traditional classroom
                education and he took the path of entrepreneurship…a road that
                led him to become one of the wealthiest men in Hawaii. Robert’s
                poor dad struggled financially all his life, and these two
                dads—these very different points of view of money, investing,
                and employment—shaped Robert’s thinking about money.
